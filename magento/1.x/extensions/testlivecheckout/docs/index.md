# Test Live Checkout

This documentation is for the Magento 1.x version. For the Magento 2.x version, see [here](https://nickolasburr.github.io/magento/2.x/extensions/testlivecheckout/latest/).

## Overview

Test Live Checkout is a Magento extension intended for use with automated browser testing tools, such as [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer).
Automated browser testing simulates real user behaviors through a series of instructions, allowing you to discover subtle bugs which impact your bottom line.
Test Live Checkout provides the ability to complete the sales transaction pipeline, by allowing an automated browser test to POST an order, as if it were a real
user submitting an order.
