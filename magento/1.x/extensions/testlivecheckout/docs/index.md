# Test Live Checkout

This documentation is for the Magento 1.x version. For the Magento 2.x version, see [here](https://nickolasburr.github.io/magento/2.x/extensions/testlivecheckout/latest/).

## Preamble

Test Live Checkout is a fairly priced Magento extension, costing only $49.99 USD. If you're uncertain about whether or not you want to purchase, please consider the following:

> The average online order (across all major industries) is approximately $82 USD. If Test Live Checkout is able to save just _one_ order of equal value,
> it will have covered its cost in revenue by 1.64x. That's a very small price to pay for such a useful asset.

## Overview

Test Live Checkout is a Magento extension intended for use with automated browser testing tools, such as [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer).
Automated browser testing simulates real user behaviors through a series of instructions, allowing you to discover subtle bugs which impact your bottom line.
Test Live Checkout provides the ability to complete the sales transaction pipeline, by allowing an automated browser test to `POST` an order, as if it were a real
user submitting an order.
