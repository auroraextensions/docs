This has several advantages over the historical approach, which is to create simple test products and submit the order outside of a browser context.\n\n\nQuick Start\n\n\n\n\nInstall \nDocker\n\n\nInstall \nNode\n\n\nClone \ndockerized-magento\n and follow setup guide\n\n\n\n\nOnce dockerized-magento has completed setup, you need to install the Test Live Checkout extension.\n\n\nAfter installing the extension, complete the following:\n\n\n\n\nLog into Admin area and navigate to \nSystem\n -> \nConfiguration\n -> \nNEB Extensions\n (left sidebar) -> \nTest Live Checkout\n\n\nSet \nEnable Live Checkout Testing\n to \nYes\n\n\nGenerate 32 character alphanumeric authentication token and paste into \nAuthentication Token\n field\n\n\nIf you want a custom redirect URL, add it to the \nRedirect URL\n field.
