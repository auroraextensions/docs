## About

Test Live Checkout is a Magento extension intended for use with automated browser testing tools, such as [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer).
Automated browser tests simulate real user behaviors through a series of instructions, allowing you to discover subtle, difficult bugs which impact your bottom line.

Test Live Checkout provides the ability to complete the sales transaction pipeline, by allowing an automated browser test to submit an order in the same fashion a real user
would submit an order. This has several advantages over the historical approach, which is to create simple test products and submit the order outside of a browser context.

## Download

The extension is available for purchase [here](https://marketplace.magento.com/nickolasburr-test-live-checkout.html).
