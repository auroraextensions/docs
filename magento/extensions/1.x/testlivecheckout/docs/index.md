# Overview

> This documentation is for the Magento 1.x version. For the Magento 2.x version, see [here](https://nickolasburr.github.io/magento/extensions/2.x/testlivecheckout/latest).

## Background

Automated browser testing is an established paradigm that allows a developer to programmatically control a web browser through an API. While it may not seem obvious
at first, this is especially valuable for online retailers because it allows a developer to simulate real user behaviors within the context of a web browser, providing
a mechanism for testing aspects of your storefront.

## About

Test Live Checkout for Magento 1.x is intended for use with automated browser testing tools, such as [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) and [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org).
By allowing authenticated users to submit test orders using real products on live storefronts, Test Live Checkout for Magento 1.x can help with the discovery and
remediation of issues affecting your checkout, and, ultimately, your bottom line.
