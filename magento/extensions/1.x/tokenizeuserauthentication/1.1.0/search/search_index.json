See Where to buy if you've not yet purchased the extension. Read Caveats to familiarize yourself with potential issues and risks. Getting Started To get started, we'll show how to install the extension via modman and manually. modman cd /var/www # Replace with the Magento root directory modman init # Only run if you haven't initialized modman yet. mkdir -p .modman/NickolasBurr_TokenizeUserAuthentication && \\ tar -C .modman/NickolasBurr_TokenizeUserAuthentication \\ -xzf /path/to/NickolasBurr_TokenizeUserAuthentication-1.1.0.tgz The extension archive does not contain a modman file, but one is available here . Run the following to add the modman file to the extension root directory: curl -fsL https://docs.auroraextensions.com/magento/extensions/1.x/tokenizeuserauthentication/latest/examples/modman \\ > .modman/NickolasBurr_TokenizeUserAuthentication/modman Lastly, deploy the updates: modman deploy NickolasBurr_TokenizeUserAuthentication Manual # Replace /var/www with the Magento root directory. cd /var/www mkdir -p /tmp/NickolasBurr_TokenizeUserAuthentication && \\ tar -C /tmp/NickolasBurr_TokenizeUserAuthentication \\ -xzf /path/to/NickolasBurr_TokenizeUserAuthentication-1.1.0.tgz rsync -Pahmvz --stats \\ --exclude=\"package.xml\" /tmp/NickolasBurr_TokenizeUserAuthentication/* ./ rm -rf /tmp/NickolasBurr_TokenizeUserAuthentication Wrap Up Before attempting to configure the extension, make sure to clear the configuration cache, and, if any admin sessions are open, log out and log back in. Caveats There are specific areas where close attention to detail should be given to help minimize potential issues and risks. Properly managing an SMTP server is tedious and susceptible to unnecessary risks. It is highly recommended to use a third-party email provider like Mailgun or SendGrid. Make sure to test emails prior to installation. If, for whatever reason, you are not able to send emails from Magento, you'll need to disable the extension to access admin and customer accounts.
