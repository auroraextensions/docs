## What is Google Stackdriver?

Stackdriver aggregates metrics, logs, and events from infrastructure, giving developers
and operators a rich set of observable signals that speed root-cause analysis and reduce
mean time to resolution (MTTR). Stackdriver doesn't require extensive integration or multiple
"panes of glass", and it won't lock developers into using a particular cloud provider.
