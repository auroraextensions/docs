Project Roadmap
===============

Simple Returns is an active project, and like most active projects, we have an approximate
roadmap for where we see the project heading. While it is not an absolute guarantee, we will
try our best to honor the projections we make herein, and will make note when a projection is
changing.

If you have any feedback or concerns, please feel free to `submit an issue <https://github.com/auroraextensions/simplereturns/issues>`_.
