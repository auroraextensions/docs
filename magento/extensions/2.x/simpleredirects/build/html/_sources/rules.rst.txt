Rules
-----

In this guide, we'll talk about two different types of rules: *atomic* and *composite*.
Atomic rules are simple, single-purpose rules and are the building blocks of Simple Redirects.
Composite rules are just atomic rules that are chained together, which allows for multiple
conditions when applying rules.
